Question 1
What are the basic object interaction tasks?

✅ Selection (Choosing which object to interact with)

✅ Positioning (Moving an object to a new location)

✅ Rotation (Changing an object's orientation)

✅ Scaling (Changing an object's size)

Question 2
When an object is fully tracked in a 3D space with both its position and rotation, how many degrees of freedom (DoF) does it have?

❌ 3DoF

❌ 4DoF

❌ 5DoF

✅ 6DoF (3 degrees for position: X, Y, Z axes; and 3 degrees for rotation: pitch, yaw, roll)

Question 3
What is the correct order of the following tasks when you want to move an object to a new location? (A) release the button to release the object; (B) press a button to confirm selection; (C) move the object to a new location; (D) move hand in 3D space to the object

❌ (A) (B) (C) (D)

✅ (D) (B) (C) (A)

❌ (B) (D) (A) (C)

❌ (B) (D) (C) (A)

(You must first (D) move your hand to the object, then (B) press the button to grab it, then (C) move it to the new spot, and finally (A) release the button to let it go.)

Question 4
Which of the following are true about the GO-Go technique introduced in the hyper-natural interaction video?

✅ Within about 2/3 of my arm length, my virtual arm remains the same length as my real arm. (This 1:1 mapping in the "near-field" allows for precise, natural interaction.)

❌ The virtual arm could grow infinitely long. (The extension is non-linear and grows very large, but it is not technically infinite.)

✅ The go-go technique was invented to help select objects beyond reach in VR. (This is its primary purpose.)

Question 5
How can one select objects out of reach?

✅ Navigate closer to the object until it's within reach (Using locomotion to move your whole body.)

✅ Use hyper-natural methods to extend the user's arm in order to reach the object (This is the "Go-Go" technique.)

✅ Use virtual pointer to point at the object of interest. (This is "ray casting" or magic interaction.)

Question 6
When a selection is confirmed, either with natural hand or magic interaction, the system should confirm this selection by:

✅ Making a sound (Auditory feedback)

✅ Changing the colour of the object (Visual feedback, like highlighting)

✅ Generating a small vibration on the controller. (Haptic feedback)

(All three are valid and commonly used forms of feedback.)

Question 7
If both the head and controllers are position tracked, we can hold the controller in front of our head and imagine a virtual ray which shoots from my head going through the controllers in a straight line to the object you want to select. This method is called:

❌ Occlusion

✅ Ray casting (This describes a method of aiming a virtual pointer, which is fundamentally ray casting.)

❌ World-in-miniature

❌ Framing

Ray casting y Occlusion
Ray casting y World-in-miniature
Occlusion y World-in-miniature
Occlusion y Framing	Occlusion 
World-in-miniature y Framing

Question 8
Which of the following is true?

✅ Magic interaction sometimes out perform simple hand interaction in object selection (True. Ray casting is much faster for selecting a distant object than physically walking over to it.)

❌ Magic interaction sometimes out perform simple hand interaction in object manipulation (True. For example, rotating a large piece of furniture is often easier with a "magic" gesture than trying to physically "grab" and turn it naturally.)

Question 9
Which is the most important user evaluation factor across all applications?

❌ Ease of use

❌ Ease of learning

❌ Efficiency

✅ User comfort (If an application makes the user sick (cybersickness) or causes physical strain, it is unusable, regardless of how efficient or easy to learn it is. Comfort is the foundational requirement.)

Question 10
Which of the following is specifically important for therapy and training applications in VR?

❌ Task performance

❌ Usability

✅ Natural, realistic, and immersive (For therapy (like phobia treatment) or training (like surgery simulation) to be effective, the user must believe they are "there." This requires a high degree of immersion and realism.)
