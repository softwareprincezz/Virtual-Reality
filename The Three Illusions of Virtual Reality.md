Question 3 What are the necessary conditions of plausibility illusion?
**Events happening in VR is related personally to you.
The world responds to you
Credibility**

4. Question 4 We say system A is more immersive than system B when 
we can simulate system A with system B
we cannot simulate system A with system B
**we can use system A to simulate system B**
we can use system B to simulate system A

5.Question 5 What's the definition of place illusion?
It's a technical description of what a system can deliver. 
**It's the strong feeling of being in a virtual place despite the fact that you know you are not.**

6.Question 6 Which of the following support plausibility illusion?
An avatar in VR going through repetitive motions

9. Question 8 What's the definition of plausibility illusion?
Plausibility illusion describes the illusion when your natural sensorimotor contingency is supported by the system.
**Plausibility illusion is the illusion that the events are happening**

9.Question 9 Which of the following statement is true?
Place illusion is cognitive
Plausibility illusion is perceptual
**Experiences in HMD is more immersive than reading a book**

10. Question 10 x Which of the following is right about place illusion and plausibility illusion?
**If place illusion breaks, it could come back again.**
If place illusion breaks, it would be very difficult to get it back again.
If plausibility illusion breaks, it could come back again.
**If plausibility illusion breaks, it would be very difficult to get it back again.**

11. Question 11 In the real-life version of the rubber hand illusion, the brain tries to resolve conflicting perceptual signals and came up with a solution that the rubber hand is the real hand. During the process, which signal(s) overwrote which?
Vision and proprioception overwrote tactile
**Vision and tactile overwrote proprioception**
Tactile and proprioception overwrote vision

12. Question 12 The rubber hand illusion in real-life is normally generated with [ ] synchrony. In virtual reality, we can also generate the illusion with [ ] synchrony
visual-proprioception; visual-motor
visual-motor; visual-proprioception
**visual-tactile; visual-motor**
visual-motor; visual-tactile

13.Question 13 x Which of the following could trigger embodiment illusion?
**Putting an avatar where you expect your own body to be (visual-proprioception synchrony)
Visual-motor synchrony
Visual-tactile synchrony**
Using an avatar in VR who looks similar to the user

14.Question 14
Which of the following are needed to setup an embodiment VR lab, where users can have full-body ownership illusion?
CAVE
**wide field-of-view HMD with head tracking
Body tracking solution (it can be a high-end camera system, or a Kinect, or a couple of hand trackers)**

15. Question 15 Which of the following are true about embodiment illusion in VR?
**Having the shape of a child body in VR alters our perception of size.
Having the body of someone from a different racial group reduces our implicit racial bias.
Body ownership illusion could also help us to change attitude about ourselves.**
