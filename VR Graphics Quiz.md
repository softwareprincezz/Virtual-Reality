Question 1
What is a keyframe?
The outcome of a collision
A single image of an animation
**An important frame in a motion that is set by an animator**
The process of turning 3D objects into a 2D image

Question 2
You are creating an office scene. Which of the following tasks would you use a scale transform for?
Position the desk to the right of the room.
changing the colour of the desk.
Turning the desk so that is faces away from the window.
**Making the desk smaller so it fits the appropriate space.**

Question 3
You are building a simple table out of 3D primitives, like the one below. Which of the following would be the best hierarchy of component objects?
**Table object**
Legs under the top:
full heirarchy
flat hierarchy:

Question 4
What is different about the camera in a VR scene? (tick all that apply)
The VR design can position the camera where they like to best frame the shot for a particular scene.
The camera performs a perspective transform to draw the 3D objects in a scene to a 2D image.
**You need 2 cameras: one for each eye.
The transform of the cameras needs to follow the users head based on tracking**

Question 5
What is the name of the process of applying an image to the surface of an object?
**texture mapping**
material
rendering
meshing

Question 6
Which of the following would be good uses of texture mapping
Making an object thinner
Adding a nose to a character.
**Making a human character have the correct appearance of skin.
Making an object stripy**

Question 7
What is rendering?
The process of rotating an object so that is faces the correct direction.
The process of applying a 2D image onto a 3D object.
**The process of projecting a 3D scene into a 2D image.**
A method for speeding up VR scenes by automatically reducing the number of polygons in an object if they are far away from the camera or otherwise will appear small on screen.
