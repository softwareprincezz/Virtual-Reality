Question 1
Which of the following statements about 2D user interfaces are true? Select all that apply.

✅ Traditional keyboard and mouse does not work well with VR applications partially because when you have the HMD on, you cannot see them.

✅ Keyboard and mouse are designed for 2D interaction; in VR the interaction is in a 3D space so they are no longer the best fit.

❌ We are more familiar with traditional 2D user interfaces such as keyboard and mouse, and less familiar how to interact in a 3D space.

❌ 2D user interfaces should be avoided in VR. (This is too absolute; 2D interfaces are often used effectively for menus and information display in VR.)

Question 2
Which of the following are types of active interaction? Select all that apply.

❌ Tracking step counts with fitness tracker (This is passive; the system responds to your state without a direct command.)

✅ Switching on lights by pressing the light switch (A direct, intentional user action causes a result.)

✅ Scroll down pages via touch screen on phones (A direct, intentional user action causes a result.)

❌ Rotating your head in VR and the graphics updates automatically according to the new viewing angle. (This is considered an active interaction as the user intentionally acts to change their view.)

Question 3
What is magical interaction?

❌ Interaction that is possible both in VR and the real world (This is natural interaction.)

✅ Interaction that is possible in VR but not in the real world. (e.g., teleportation, flying)

❌ Interaction that is possible in the real world but not in VR.

❌ Interaction that is not possible in VR or the real world.

Question 4
Which of the following are true about magic and natural interaction? Select all that apply.

❌ Magic interaction is superior than realistic interaction because it empowers people (The best choice depends on the application's goal.)

✅ Some magical interfaces can be much more efficient than realistic interfaces. (e.g., Teleportation is faster than virtual walking.)

✅ Natural interaction is about creating new ways to interact with VR applications using our whole bodies rather than just fingers on buttons.

❌ It’s always better to use gestural interaction whenever possible because it’s more natural. (Gestural interaction can be imprecise and physically tiring.)

Question 5
How could JJ Gibson’s Affordance theory be used in VR?

❌ We could use dropdown menus in VR to make everything more obvious.

✅ We should design objects to make it obvious whether and how users could interact with them. For instance if users can open a door it should have a handle. (The design of an object should suggest its function.)

❌ We should provide feedback so the users know whether they’ve done an action right or not. (This describes feedback, a separate design principle.)

Question 6
Which of the following are true about VR user input? Select all that apply.

✅ If the only user input we have is head rotation, which comes as a default with all VR devices, we can use it for basic tasks such as moving around and object selection. (This is known as gaze-based interaction.)

✅ We can use voice for user input.

❌ Full body tracking devices such as Kinect and LeapMotion is very easy to set up and reliable. (They can be difficult to configure and prone to tracking errors.)

❌ We can use head rotation to define travel direction because this is the most natural way and works with all applications. (This can cause motion sickness and is not a universal solution.)

Question 7
Which of the following are examples of affordances (choose all that apply)

❌ Buttons on a control panel in a VR world that you can't interact with (This is a false affordance.)

✅ A mug that you can pick up by the handle. (The handle affords gripping.)

✅ A door handle that you can pull to open the door. (The handle affords pulling.)

❌ Trees swaying in the background of your VR scene (This is an environmental effect, not an interactive element.)

Question 8
The lights turning on when you walk into a room is an example of

❌ magical interaction

❌ a graphical user interface

❌ active interaction

✅ passive interaction (The system reacts to the user's presence without a direct command.)

Question 9
Which of these does google cardboard track (select all that apply)

✅ head rotation (It tracks pitch, yaw, and roll, which is 3 Degrees of Freedom or 3-DoF.)

❌ head position (This requires 6-DoF tracking.)

❌ controller position

❌ controller rotation

Question 10
Pushing a door in VR is an example of which type of interaction

❌ passive interaction

✅ Natural interaction (It mimics a real-world action.)

❌ Magical interaction

❌ a false affordance

Question 11
Why do we want to make VR interaction as close as possible to how we interact with the real world?

❌ It is easy to learn (While true, this is a result of the primary goal.)

✅ It supports plausibility illusion (Making interactions realistic is key to making the user believe the virtual world is real and consistent.)

❌ It is automatically usable

❌ It doesn't require complex hardware (It often requires more complex hardware.)

Question 12
Which of the following can be done with a standard high end VR set up (e.g. Oculus Rift + Touch or HTC VIVE)

✅ Move small distances by walking (This is known as room-scale VR.)

❌ Controlling an avatar so that it exactly mirrors your facial expressions (Requires special face-tracking hardware.)

❌ Using your feet to control a virtual skateboard (Requires special foot trackers.)

✅ Picking up and throwing a ball (A classic use of 6-DoF tracked controllers.)

Question 13
Which of the following are features of all good interaction design, including VR? (Select all that apply)

❌ Plausibility (This is specific to VR/AR and simulations.)

✅ Discoverability (Users should be able to figure out what is possible.)

✅ Feedback (The system should communicate its status and acknowledge user actions.)

✅ Unambiguity (The purpose of an interface element should be clear.)

❌ Embodiment (This is a VR-specific concept.)

Question 14
All VR systems support head position tracking.

❌ True

✅ False (Basic systems like Google Cardboard only support head rotation tracking, not position.)

Question 15
Imagine a VR tennis game which you play by swinging a virtual racket with your hands. Which of the following describe this interaction (choose all that apply)

❌ It is magical

✅ It can be implemented with HTC VIVE (The VIVE has tracked controllers perfect for this.)

❌ It needs a graphical user interface (The core swinging interaction itself does not, though the overall game likely would for menus/scoring.)

✅ It is active (The user is intentionally performing an action.)

❌ It can be implemented with google cardboard (Cardboard has no hand/controller tracking.)

✅ It is natural (It mimics a real-world action.)
