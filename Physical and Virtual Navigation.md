Question 1
Physical walking is the most naturalistic way to move around in VR. What is the biggest challenge in physical walking? 


It is difficult to represent mapping between the virtual body and the real body



The virtual space will be limited to the user's physical space. *



Not all VR systems support physical walking 



There are health and safety concerns with physical walking as we cannot see the real world while walking around


Question 2
Which of the following statements are true about redirected walking? Select all that apply.
Using redirected walking, we could create the illusion of walking along an infinite line regardless of the size of the physical space.
In redirected walking we rotate user’s view slightly to trick them into walking a slightly curved line while thinking that they are walking a straight line. The angle of rotation should be a function of the user’s linear velocity.* 
Redirected walking is part of physical walking*
Redirected walking is part of virtual walking

Question 3
Which of the following statements are true about Walk-in-place? Select all that apply.
Both walk-in-place and physical walking usually use the user’s head rotation to define direction of traveling
Walk-in-place encourages users to use their whole body in realistic walking motion as much as possible, without actually moving forward. *
Walk-in-place could use user’s head tracking, head movements, or leg movements, or a combination of them to control their speed of travelling*
As Walk-in-place is very intuitive, there is no need to give user specific instructions or have a test run.

Question 4
Which of the following methods could reduce nausea? Select all that apply.
Use user’s head direction as direction of travel*
Use a constant speed*
Use a constant acceleration*
Use more naturalistic way to define speed of travel*

Question 5
Which of the following statements are true about teleporting? Select all that apply.
With model based VR, in some applications pre-defined targets can be used for users to travel to, in other applications users can travel anywhere.*
With 360 video VR, in some applications pre-defined targets can be used for users to travel to, in other applications users can travel anywhere.
When teleporting the user to a new location, their orientation should be preserved*
